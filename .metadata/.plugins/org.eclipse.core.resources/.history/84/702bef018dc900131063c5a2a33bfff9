Description: PillTracker is an Android application that allows the user to track the pills they need to take. 

Status Update as of 04/21/2014:  

We have laid out XML files for every button on the home screen. (Med log is currently crashing - we are still working on that) 

We have added the full functionality of the "Prescriptions" tab. You can add in new prescriptions and it is displayed in the tab itself. 
We have gotten the database working. When you edit the prescription it also creates reminders and it is being stored in the reminders database.
We have written the backend for doctors and just need to connect it all. 

The following things are what we still need to do:
- reminders - push notifications
	- take you to medication log
- reminders screen setup
	- dialog box for editing
	- modify database
- medication log checkbox save state

If we have time, we will work on pharmacies and notes.
